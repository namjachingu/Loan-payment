# Loan-payment
In this project, a model that can predict whether a person will be able to pay back the loan they have acquired was built. 

The script first investigates the data by visualizing and comparing various features against each other. Secondly, data preprocessing is performed where features with missing data are either dropped or replaced by mean values. Additionally, some of the data are object types, and in order to pass the data into our machine learning model, it is necessary to convert those objects into integer values. 

Towards the end, the model is defined and trained on the preprocessed data. A prediction is also made. 

This model could be useful in future for cases where new potential costumers are interested in taking up a loan. The company would be able to assess whether or not the costumer will be able to pay back the loan.
