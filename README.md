# Loan-payment
In this project, we are building a model that can predict whether a person will be able to pay back the loan they have acquired. 

The python file first investigates how the data looks like by plotting various features against each other. Further down the script, data preprocessing is performed where features with empty lines are either dropped or replaced by mean values. Additionally, some of the data are object types, and in order to pass the data into our machine learning model, it is necessary to convert those objects into integer values. 

Towards the end, the model is defined and trained on the preprocessed data. A prediction is also made. 

This model could be useful in future for cases where new potential costumers are interested in taking up a loan. The company would be able to assess whether or not the costumer will be able to pay back the loan.
